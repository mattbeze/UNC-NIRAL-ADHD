This folder is used to organize and sort the IBIS/Gilmore data for scaling for imputations.
The .ipynb takes the original IBIS data (SA_and_CT_AALandfROI_08272019.xlsx) which has been sorted into 1 and 2 year data for CT and SA, creates minmax scalers for it and transforms both the gilmore and ibis data.
These transformed dataframes are saved into .xlsx spreadsheets.
